                        Thank you for visiting my portfolio website. Your privacy is important to me, and this policy outlines how I handle any personal information that you may provide. This website collects minimal data and only when you voluntarily provide it. If you reach out through a contact form or email, I may collect your name, email address, and the content of your message to respond appropriately. Additionally, basic, anonymous usage data—such as page visits, browser type, and device information—may be collected for analytics purposes to help improve website performance. This usage data does not personally identify you.
